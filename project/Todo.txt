Make font scale on resolution
Support for unicode characters (font map)
Remove text shader from textClass
Change TextArea to use mask texture, instead of stencil buffer (performance)
TextArea scrollable text, (horz & vert)
Gui focus control

Fix fullscreen mode

Gui quad instances

Rework custom allocators

Fix crash if mesh data size is equal to zero (Render Engine)

Threading
	add sync point. stall main thread until all worker threads are done etc
	add more assets to task loading.
	add more tasks, like save to file, actions, other data processing, physics, script execution.
	

Other Gui types
	Buttons
	CheckBox
	Lists
	ComboBox
	Tree
	ColorChooser
	ModelPreview
	Simple TextField
	Label
	ProgressBar

Loader implementation (threadable)
	textures
	models
	animations
	etc.

Scripting
	lexer and parser
	codegen? (bytecode)
	scripting in console
	various batch jobs
		like world interaction
		background jobs


Asset
	// allways (base asset)
	uint32_t dataSize;
	void* dataPtr;

	uint32_t assetID;
	enum assetType;
	enum assetState; (loaded, unloaded, etc)

	// asset specific
	int32_t width, height;	// texure only
	int32_t nrKeyFrames;	// animation only
	int32_t nrBones;		// animation only



Asset creation
	mainThread creates asset object.
	Task is created to move data to asset object.
		task copies data (from file, memory or network)
		task notify asset object it is host complete (CPU side)
		task terminates and worker thread waits for new task
	mainThread check if asset object is complete when rendering or other parts of code needs it
		if not complete nothing should happen
