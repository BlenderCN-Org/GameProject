Simulation Steps (Rigid vs Static ONLY)

	STEP 0:
	Update ALL Rigid Body objects (Can be threaded)
		IF NOT body->frozen THEN
			update velocity
			copy position -> oldPosition
			update position
			add to Sim STEP 1
			
	STEP 1:
	RayCast collision course
		Find closest boundary group by check through octree
			IF found boudary THEN
				IF boundary distance - Rb radius < COLLIDE_BND_THRESHOLD
					add to Sim STEP 2

	STEP 2:
	More detailed collision checking
		if collided
			add STEP 3

	STEP 3:
	IF COLLIDED
		response
